# Getting started

Hyperdemon can be a very daunting game to pickup. To be brutally honest, it's a game designed for tryhards only. 
The goal of this site is to help you pickup most of the mechanics and basic routes / interactions the game has to offer,
so you can quickly improve and get past the initial hours where nothing makes sense and the game feels impossible.

  [^1]:
    Difficulty for this game is flexible, as in, enemies spawn only as fast as you kill other enemies. So if you are slow, then the game will go slow. If you are fast, the game will go fast.


## Settings

### Video

#### Fov
This is the value for your field of vision. Although it's personal preference, the community tends to play between 120-150 , any number inside that range will be very playable. Experiment with the numbers and see what you prefer.

#### V-sync
Enables or disables v-sync. You probably want this off.

#### Frame limit
You can cap your FPS with this option. I personally use uncapped (set to 2000)
