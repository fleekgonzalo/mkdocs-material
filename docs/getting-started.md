# Getting started

Hyperdemon can be a very daunting game to pickup. To be brutally honest, it's a game designed for tryhards only. 
The goal of this site is to help you pickup most of the mechanics and basic routes / interactions the game has to offer,
so you can quickly improve and get past the initial hours where nothing makes sense and the game feels impossible.

## Settings

### Video

#### Fov
This is the value for your field of vision. Although it's personal preference, the community tends to play between 120-150 , any number inside that range will be very playable. Experiment with the numbers and see what you prefer.

#### V-sync
Enables or disables v-sync. You probably want this off.

#### Frame limit
You can cap your FPS with this option. I personally use uncapped (set to 2000)

#### High resolution peripheral
On this game, you can see enemies that are directly behind you, they are rendered on your screen as red holograms.
This option will determine wether those holograms are high resolution or not. If your PC can handle it, I'd leave it on.
For lower end setups you might want to consider turning this off. In my opinion there isn't a noticeable difference between the two options.

### Audio

#### Volume 
Adjust to preference. Volume is not mandatory but pretty important , specially when learning the game, so don't neglect it.

#### Music
Music only applies in the main menu, so adjust to your liking.

### Controls

#### Keybindings
Most players (including top players) use default keybindings. You can switch them to your liking, but it's recommended that you leave them as default.
The game has very minimalistic controls but you can use and combine them to achieve a wide variety of moves ingame.
The controls at the bottom refer to the replay controls, you can switch those to whatever is more comfortable to you , it won't affect your gameplay. Just don't override any important binds!

#### Left handed
Switches your hand between right / left. 
Impact is only visual, so whatever you like best.

#### Invert y axis
Don't be a weirdo.

#### Look speed
This is your sensitivty. It's purely preference, but at higher levels you will need to do quick 180 turns and overall a lot of mouse movements, so unless you have a lot of energy in your arm, consider using a medium to high sens.


  [^1]:
    Difficulty for this game is flexible, as in, enemies spawn only as fast as you kill other enemies. So if you are slow, then the game will go slow. If you are fast, the game will go fast.
